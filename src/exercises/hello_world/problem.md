> This is the first exercise, and probably your user's first impression about your module. Take some time to explain what this is about, what they can expect.

workshopper-mocha-boilerplate is a boilerplate for workshopper modules written with ES6 and Mocha.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

> The problem statement. Lay out what the exercise is about, what are the prerequisites. Try to finish with a simple, actionable sentence so that the user knows what is expected of them. Be specific.

First things first! We want to make sure that you're all set, let's start small.

Write a function that takes a `name` as parameter and returns a Hello, World! message. For example, if `name` is `"JavaScript"`, your function should return `"Hello, JavaScript!"`.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

> Give further guidance to the user. Sometimes, boilerplate code to copy and paste can be very useful: there's no point in making them guess.

Here is some boilerplate:

```js
export default function helloWorld(name) {
    // TODO: Return the Hello, World! message for `name`.
}
```

> For the first couple of exercises, remind them how this is supposed to work.

When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.js
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked `[COMPLETED]` if you are successful.
